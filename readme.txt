Shows currency exchange rates for Belarus

== Description ==

Shows currency exchange rates for Belarus.
We use the web service of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, 
which sets the current exchange rates for each day for the Republic of Belarus and provides a free API for developers.
To keep the exchange rate up to date, our plugin makes a request twice a day and stores the result in a database for use on the website.
